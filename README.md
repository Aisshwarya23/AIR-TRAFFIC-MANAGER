# AIR-TRAFFIC-MANAGER

Airplane Management System – EMU8086

A console-based aviation control simulation developed using 8086 Assembly Language on EMU8086.
This project demonstrates low-level programming concepts through a menu-driven interface that manages essential aviation tasks such as Flight Management, Air Traffic Control, and Fuel Monitoring.



🔹 Overview

The Airplane Management System provides a simplified model of real-world flight operations.
It uses BIOS interrupts, keyboard inputs, and ASCII-based graphics to create an interactive aviation dashboard.



✨ Features

Flight Management
Add flight details, calculate travel duration, and compute arrival times.

Air Traffic Control (ATC)
Simulates runway access, landing permissions, and simple conflict detection.

Fuel Monitoring
Displays current fuel levels and shows alerts when fuel is low.

Graphical ASCII Output
Aircraft, runway, and radar visuals created using character-based graphics.

Efficient Low-Level Logic
Uses INT 10h, INT 21h, loops, string operations, and modular procedures.
